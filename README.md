### **Task Automation Procedure Explanation**

Automating tasks like organizing files involves a structured process to ensure smooth execution and minimal errors. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to the procedure:

---

### **1. Define the Task**
   - Clearly identify the task to automate. For example:
     - Organizing files by extension.
     - Deleting old files.
     - Backing up specific files.

---

### **2. Analyze and Plan**
   - Understand the scope and requirements:
     - What is the source folder?
     - What criteria will be used for organizing (e.g., file extensions, size, modification date)?
     - Will there be error handling, like name conflicts?
   - Plan how the task will be structured:
     - Input/output paths.
     - Folder hierarchy.

---

### **3. Break Task into Sub-Tasks**
   - Divide the task into logical steps:
     - **Identify files**: Read the folder and get a list of files.
     - **Categorize files**: Determine their grouping logic (e.g., by extension, type, or size).
     - **Perform actions**: Execute the required actions (move, rename, delete, etc.).
     - **Handle errors**: Deal with potential issues (e.g., name conflicts, missing files).

---

### **4. Develop Automation Script**
   - Use a programming language like **Python** for flexibility and simplicity.
     - Libraries
